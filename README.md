An intermediate Solidity project could be to create a decentralized escrow contract for buying and selling goods or services. The contract would allow a buyer and seller to agree on a set of conditions for the transaction (such as the price, delivery date, and quality of goods), and then escrow the payment until those conditions are met.

The contract could have functions for the buyer to deposit funds into the escrow, for the seller to confirm receipt of the goods or services, and for the buyer to release the funds to the seller once the conditions have been met. The contract could also have timeout conditions to prevent the funds from being locked up indefinitely if the buyer or seller fails to fulfill their obligations.

To make the contract more secure and user-friendly, you could also consider using an Oracle to verify that the conditions of the transaction have been met (for example, by checking a delivery tracking number or inspecting the quality of the goods), and implementing a dispute resolution process in case the buyer and seller cannot agree on whether the conditions have been met.

This project would require intermediate-level Solidity skills, as it involves working with multiple functions and data structures, as well as incorporating external tools like Oracles. It also requires careful consideration of security and usability, since the contract will be handling users' funds and sensitive transaction information.
